# DIGIT Urban Stack 

The DIGIT Urban Stack is a digital public good that transforms urban governance by enabling digital-first interactions between citizens and local government bodies. Designed to drive large-scale impact across towns and cities, it fosters the co-creation of localized solutions that enhance service delivery, streamline operations, and ultimately improve the quality of life for citizens. By reimagining local governance, DIGIT not only empowers communities but also contributes to national economic development.

DIGIT offers a suite of open APIs, microservices, and reference implementations, freely available as a public good. This infrastructure allows governments, startups, businesses, and civil society organizations to build scalable urban solutions using a shared digital foundation. It promotes innovation by providing open standards, detailed documentation, and a level playing field for all ecosystem stakeholders.

With a strong focus on inclusion, DIGIT emphasizes openness and citizen choice. The platform's architecture is based on open standards and APIs, ensuring seamless integration with existing systems and encouraging the development of contextually relevant solutions. Recognizing that mobile devices are the primary mode of internet access for most Indians, DIGIT embraces a "mobile-first" philosophy while supporting multiple access channels to serve diverse user needs.
